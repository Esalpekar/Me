                    <h3>AIXI approximator</h3>
                    <img src="../assets/images/aixi_project.jpg" alt="AIXI approximator project" class="project-image">
                    <p>AIXI (Hutter 2005) is a formalization of a universal, ideal, and uncomputable agent. It maximizes a reward metric in an unknown environment. I asked: How many practical deviations from this ideal must be taken to achieve a functional agent?</p>

                    <p>Keeping tabs on every deviation, I adapted AIXI to work through tasks using LLMs and a continuously updated model of its environment:</p>

                    <p>A constitution serves as the agent's moral and productive guide. A judge evaluates each of the agent's actions against the constitution, and returns a detailed report. This is the reward percept.</p>

                    <p>Tools are recast as "sub-environments:" self-manifested models of the true environment which are sampled to receive an observation.</p>

                    <p>A key philosophy of this project is that the data flow is entirely text-based. No attempts are made to compress data into quantitative metrics: essays are low-density but high-fidelity, and attention mechanisms do a better job of picking out the meaningful stuff than I can. Optimization then becomes solely a compression challenge.</p>

                    <h3>Custom Backtesting Engine</h3>
                    <img src="../assets/images/backtesting_project.jpg" alt="Custom Backtesting Engine project" class="project-image">
                    <p>A simple backtesting engine on which I test predictive trading strategies. Pulls historical data from a variety of sources, and returns a variety of plots and stats in a cute little HTML report.</p>

                    <p>Existing backtesting engines like LEAN aren't tailored to reporting the intrinsic metrics of ML models. For my workflow, I wanted to get feedback on both my Pytorch skills and my finance skills simultaneously.</p>

                    <img src="../assets/images/billing_project.jpg" alt="Billing Data Cleaner project" class="project-image">
                    <p>As an intern at OxBlue, I saw a problem: at the top of each month, senior accountants were spending a full day cleaning up malformed billing reports so that they could be uploaded to our accounting software. This was tedious, so I automated it.</p>

                    <p>The program fixes the formulaic issues and flags data that needs human attention to resolve. Remaining data is organized into an Excel workspace with a macro-powered UI for easy processing.</p>

                    <p>Uploading now takes one accountant a few hours at most, an estimated 70% reduction in effort.</p>
